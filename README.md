# Hyperledger Composer - Product Auction Network

*Read this in other languages: [한국어](README-ko.md),[中国](README-cn.md).*

Welcome to Part 2 of the Hyperledger Composer Composite Journey. This is a continuation of [Composer Network Setup journey](https://github.com/IBM/BlockchainNetwork-CompositeJourney#build-your-first-hyperledger-network). This journey introduces more complexity in using Composer to define your smart contract. You will learn how to add multiple participants and add access control to your blockchain application. To do that - you will create an interactive, distributed, product auction demo network. You will list assets for sale (setting a reserve price) and watch as assets that have met their reserve price are automatically transferred to the highest bidder at the end of the auction. Also each participant will have different level of access permissions depending on the Access Control Rules (ACL) in `permissions.acl` file. Access Control Lists (ACL) are the settings for sharing and privacy, which are automatically enforced by the Fabric Composer runtime.


This business network defines:

**Participants:**
`Member` `Seller`

**Assets:**
`Product` `ProductListing`

**Transactions:**
`AddProduct` `StartBidding` `Offer` `CloseBidding`

The `addProduct` function is called when an `AddProduct` transaction is submitted. The logic allows a seller to create a product asset and update its registry.

The `publishListing` function is called when a `StartBidding` transaction is submitted by the owner of product. The logic allows a seller to create a smart contract in the form of product listing for their product with a reserve bid.

The `makeOffer` function is called when an `Offer` transaction is submitted. The logic simply checks that the listing for the offer is still for sale, and then adds the offer to the listing, and then updates the offers in the `ProductListing` asset registry.

The `closeBidding` function is called when a `CloseBidding` transaction is submitted for processing. The logic checks that the listing is still for sale, sort the offers by bid price, and then if the reserve has been met, transfers the ownership of the product associated with the listing to the highest bidder. Money is transferred from the buyer's account to the seller's account, and then all the modified assets are updated in their respective registries.

`product.cto` file present in `models` directory defines a data model for the product auction demo which consists the definition for assets, participants and transactions. `logic.js` file present in `lib` directory implement the transactions defined in the `product.cto` file.  Recall that the `.cto` file defines the structure of your business network in terms of Assets, Participants and Transactions.

ACL rules are present in `permissions.acl` file to determine which user/role is permitted to create, read, update or delete an element in the business network's domain model. The default `System` user has all the permissions. Members of the network have read access to all the resources and the seller can create a product, start and close the bidding for their products. Members of the network can make their bid for the product listing. Participants can access only permitted resources and transactions.

## Steps
1. [Generate the Business Network Archive (BNA)](#1-generate-the-business-network-archive-bna)
2. [Deploy the Business Network Archive using Composer Playground](#2-deploy-the-business-network-archive-using-composer-playground)
3. [Deploy the Business Network Archive on Hyperledger Composer running locally](#3-deploy-the-business-network-archive-on-hyperledger-composer-running-locally)

## 1. Generate the Business Network Archive (BNA)

To check that the structure of the files is valid, you can now generate a Business Network Archive (BNA) file for your business network definition. The BNA file is the deployable unit -- a file that can be deployed to the Composer runtime for execution.

Use the following command to generate the network archive:
```bash
npm install
```
You should see the following output:
```bash
> mkdirp ./dist && composer archive create --sourceType dir --sourceName . -a ./dist/product-auction.bna

Creating Business Network Archive

Looking for package.json of Business Network Definition
	Input directory: /Users/ishan/Documents/git-demo/BlockchainBalanceTransfer-CompositeJourney

Found:
	Description: Sample product auction network
	Name: product-auction
	Identifier: product-auction@0.0.1

Written Business Network Definition Archive file to
	Output file: ./dist/product-auction.bna

Command succeeded
```
The `composer archive create` command has created a file called `product-auction.bna` in the `dist` folder.

You can test the business network definition against the embedded runtime that stores the state of 'the blockchain' in-memory in a Node.js process.
From your project working directory, open the file test/productAuction.js and run the following command:
```
npm test
```
You should see the following output :
```
> product-auction@0.0.1 test /Users/ishan/Documents/git-demo/BlockchainBalanceTransfer-CompositeJourney
> mocha --recursive

  ProductAuction - AddProduct Test
    #BiddingProcess
      ✓ Add the product to seller list (119ms)
      ✓ Authorized owner should start the bidding (90ms)
      ✓ Members bid for the product (127ms)
      ✓ Close bid for the product (53ms)


  4 passing (2s)
```

## 2. Deploy the Business Network Archive using Composer Playground

Open [Composer Playground](http://composer-playground.mybluemix.net/), by default the Basic Sample Network is imported.
If you have previously used Playground, be sure to clear your browser local storage by running `localStorage.clear()` in your browser Console. Now import the `product-auction.bna` file and click on deploy button.


To test this Business Network Definition in the **Test** tab:


In the `Seller` participant registry, create a new participant. Make sure you click on the `Seller` tab on the far left-hand side.

```
{
  "$class": "org.acme.product.auction.Seller",
  "organisation": "ACME",
  "email": "auction@acme.org",
  "balance": 100,
  "products": []
}
```

In the `Member` participant registry, create two participants. Again, click on the `Member` tab on the far left-hand side.

```
{
  "$class": "org.acme.product.auction.Member",
  "firstName": "Amy",
  "lastName": "Williams",
  "email": "memberA@acme.org",
  "balance": 1000,
  "products": []
}
```

```
{
  "$class": "org.acme.product.auction.Member",
  "firstName": "Billy",
  "lastName": "Thompson",
  "email": "memberB@acme.org",
  "balance": 1000,
  "products": []
}
```

Now we are ready to add **Access Control**. Do this by first clicking on the `admin` tab to issue **new ids** to the participants and add the ids to the wallet.
Please follow the instructions as shown in the images below:

* Click +add to my Wallet under Option 2 to actually add to your wallet.

![Admin Tab](images/admintab.png)

![Generate New Id](images/generateNewId.png)

![Add to Wallet](images/addtowallet.png)

![Ids to Wallet](images/idstowallet.png)

Select the `seller id` from `Wallet tab` tab. Now click on the `test tab` to perform `AddProduct` and `StartBidding` transactions.

![Select Id](images/selectid.png)

Now click on `Submit Transaction` button and select `AddProduct` transaction from the dropdown, to create a product for the seller.
![addproduct](images/addproduct.png)

```
{
  "$class": "org.acme.product.auction.AddProduct",
  "description": "Sample Product",
  "owner": "resource:org.acme.product.auction.Seller#auction@acme.org"
}
```
You can verify the transaction by checking the product and seller registry.

To create a product listing for the above product, copy the `ProductID` from the product registry. Then submit `StartBidding` transaction. Remember to replace `<ProductID>` with the product id you just copied.
```
{
  "$class": "org.acme.product.auction.StartBidding",
  "reservePrice": 50,
  "product": "resource:org.acme.product.auction.Product#<ProductID>"
}
```

You've just listed `Sample Product` for auction, with a reserve price of 50!
A listing has been created in `ProductListing` registry for the product with `FOR_SALE` state.

Now Member participants can submit `Offer` transactions to bid on a product listing.

For each `member id`, select the user id from the `Wallet tab`. To submit an `Offer` transaction select the `test tab` and click on `Submit Transaction` button.
> `ListingID` is the id of the listing copied from the `ProductListing` registry.

```
{
  "$class": "org.acme.product.auction.Offer",
  "bidPrice": 50,
  "listing": "resource:org.acme.product.auction.ProductListing#<ListingID>",
  "member": "resource:org.acme.product.auction.Member#memberA@acme.org"
}
```

```
{
  "$class": "org.acme.product.auction.Offer",
  "bidPrice": 100,
  "listing": "resource:org.acme.product.auction.ProductListing#<ListingID>",
  "member": "resource:org.acme.product.auction.Member#memberB@acme.org"
}
```

You can check the `ProductListing` registry, to view all the bids for the product.

![Product Offers](images/productoffers.png)

Now again select the `seller id` from the `Wallet tab` tab. Click on `test tab` to end the auction by submitting a `CloseBidding` transaction for the listing.

```
{
  "$class": "org.acme.product.auction.CloseBidding",
  "listing": "resource:org.acme.product.auction.ProductListing#<ListingID>"
}
```

This simply indicates that the auction for `ListingID` is now closed, triggering the `closeBidding` function that was described above.

To check whether the Product is sold you need to click on the `ProductListing` asset registry and check the owner of the product. The highest bid was placed by owner `memberB@acme.org`, so `memberB@acme.org` should be the owner of the product.

You can check the state of the ProductListing with `<ListingID>` is `SOLD`.

![Product Listing Sold](images/soldlisting.png)

Click on the `Member` asset registry to verify the updated balance for buyer and seller. The product is added to the product list of the buyer `memberB@acme.org`.

![New Owner of Product](images/newowner.png)

You can view history of all transactions by selecting the `All transactions` tab.

![Transaction History](images/transactions.png)

> You can also use the default `System user` to perform all the actions as we have a rule in `permissions.acl` to permit all access `System user`.

## 3. Deploy the Business Network Archive on Hyperledger Composer running locally

Please start the local Fabric using the [instructions](https://github.com/IBM/BlockchainNetwork-CompositeJourney#2-starting-hyperledger-fabric).
Now change directory to the `dist` folder containing `product-auction.bna` file and type:
```
cd dist
composer runtime install --card PeerAdmin@hlfv1 --businessNetworkName product-auction
composer network start --card PeerAdmin@hlfv1 --networkAdmin admin --networkAdminEnrollSecret adminpw --archiveFile product-auction.bna --file networkadmin.card
composer card import --file networkadmin.card
```

You can verify that the network has been deployed by typing:
```
composer network ping --card admin@product-auction
```

You should see the the output as follows:
```
The connection to the network was successfully tested: product-auction
	version: 0.16.0
	participant: org.hyperledger.composer.system.NetworkAdmin#admin

Command succeeded
```

To create the REST API we need to launch the `composer-rest-server` and tell it how to connect to our deployed business network.
Now launch the server by changing directory to the product-auction folder and type:
```bash
cd ..
composer-rest-server
```

Answer the questions posed at startup. These allow the composer-rest-server to connect to Hyperledger Fabric and configure how the REST API is generated.
* Enter `admin@product-auction` as the card name.
* Select `never use namespaces` when asked whether to use namespaces in the generated API.
* Select `No` when asked whether to secure the generated API.
* Select `Yes` when asked whether to enable event publication.
* Select `No` when asked whether to enable TLS security.

**Test REST API**

If the composer-rest-server started successfully you should see these two lines are output:
```
Web server listening at: http://localhost:3000
Browse your REST API at http://localhost:3000/explorer
```

Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/explorer

You should see the LoopBack API Explorer, allowing you to inspect and test the generated REST API. Follow the instructions to test Business Network Definition as mentioned above in the composer section.
